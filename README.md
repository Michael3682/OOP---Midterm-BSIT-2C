# BSIT 2C - Hotel Reservation System

A simple console-based Hotel Reservation System built using **C#** and **Object-Oriented Programming** principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. It allows users to select a room type, input their name and length of stay, and calculates the total cost based on room type.

## OOP Implementation

This project follows **Object-Oriented Programming** principles, ensuring clear organization and maintainability:

- **Encapsulation**: 
  - Private fields are used to store sensitive data (e.g., guest name, number of nights, and reservation date). Controlled access is provided through public properties with validation in place for inputs.
  
- **Inheritance**: 
  - Different room reservation types (e.g., `StandardRoomReservation`, `SuiteRoomReservation`, etc.) inherit from the base `Reservation` class. This promotes code reuse and organization.
  
- **Polymorphism**: 
  - The `PrintDetails()` method and `CalculateCost()` method behave differently depending on the specific type of room. Each room type has its own implementation, allowing for flexibility and extensibility.
  
- **Abstraction**: 
  - The user interacts with a simplified interface to make reservations, without needing to worry about the underlying details of each room type or cost calculations. The `Reservation` class provides a general template, while specific implementations handle the details.

## üí° Features

- Room options:
  - Standard (PHP 240.00/night, max 2 guests)
  - Suite (PHP 400.00/night, max 4 guests)
  - Deluxe (PHP 600.00/night, max 4 guests)
  - Luxury (PHP 800.00/night, max 6 guests)
- Input validation for room choice and nights
- Multiple reservation support in one session

- **Error Handling**:
  - Ensures valid input for the number of nights and room selection.
  - The system supports dynamic user input and calculates the cost based on the room type.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **Program.cs** ‚Äì Entry point of the application; handles user input and displays reservation info.
- **Reservation.cs** ‚Äì Abstract base class for all reservation types.
- **RoomTypes.cs** ‚Äì Contains derived room reservation classes (`StandardRoomReservation`, `SuiteRoomReservation`, etc.).

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Clone or download** the project.
2. Open the project folder in **Visual Studio** or any C# IDE.
3. Build the solution to restore dependencies and compile the project.
4. Run the program (usually by pressing `Ctrl + F5` or clicking the **Start** button).

## üß™ How to Test

1. Upon running, the console will prompt for:
   - Your name
   - Room type (Standard, Suite, Deluxe, or Luxury)
   - Number of nights

2. The system will calculate and display:
   - Reservation details
   - Total cost of stay

3. It will ask if you'd like to make another reservation.

4. Type **"no"** to exit the program.

## üìå Notes

- This is a console application. GUI support is not included.
- No database is used‚Äîreservations are stored temporarily in memory.
